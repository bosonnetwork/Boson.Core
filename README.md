Boson is a decentralized and encrypted peer-to-peer (P2P)  communication framework that facilitates network traffic routing between virtual machines and decentralized Applications (dApps).  Boson Java is a Java distribution designed to run on VPS servers with a public IP address, serving as a super Boson Node service.

Boson V2 is a new two-layered architecture that features a unified DHT network as the bottom layer and facilitates various application-oriented services on top of the DHT network, where a list of services includes, but is not limited to:

- An active proxy service forwards the service entries from third-parties originally located within a LAN network, making them accessible from the public;
- A federal-based decentralized communication system provides great efficiency and security, including similar features to Boson V1;
- A content addressing based storage system allows the distribtion of data among peers for the application scenarios like P2P file sharing.

**Notice**:  *the later two features have not been developed yet, but they are already included in the TODO List*.

## Guide to compiling and building to Boson Java

### Dependencies

- Java Virtual Machine (JVM) >= Java 11
- sodium (libsodium) >= 1.0.16

### Build instructions

Download this repository using Git:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/trinity-tech-io/Boson.Java
```

Then navigate to the directory with the source code downloaded:

```shell
./mvnw
```

If you want to skip the test cases, use the following command instead of the command mentioned above:

```shell
./mvnw -Dmaven.test.skip=true 
```

If you want to run build and run all test cases, using the following command:

```shell
MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx20480m -Xms10240m" ./mvnw -Dio.bosonnetwork.enviroment=development
```

Or you can run specific test with the following command, for example `NodeTests`:

```shell
MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx20480m -Xms10240m" ./mvnw -Dio.bosonnetwork.enviroment=development -am -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false -Dtest=NodeTests
```
